# SRCA-GP
This repository contains the full R code used in the my graduation project:
“Modeling Emergency Response Times Using Multiple Statistical Methods.”

Contant

	•	GP_analysis_clean.R: Complete reproducible R script for data cleaning, transformation, inferential analysis, Welch ANOVA, Games-Howell post-hoc tests, effect size estimation (η², ω²), and modeling.

	•	shinyPredModel: which is an interactive Shiny app implemented in R to predict ambulance response time for any specified case, the user selects the report source, dispatch level, location type,  and the incident type and then the app will return the expected response time according to the categories selected by the user and after applying the inverse box-cox transformation.

Data Availability:
The SRCA dataset used in this analysis cannot be shared publicly due to confidentiality restrictions.
The code, however, is fully available and documented.
